=====

* New Class syntax to replace Thingpedia manifests.
* New syntax on queries to indicate whether they are monitorable and/or lists.
* New language component: mixins and import statements.
* New language component: dataset and examples; these replace the use of declarations
  for composable code snippets in Thingpedia.
* New language component: annotations; these can be applied to function declarations
  in classes, to classes themselves, and to examples in datasets.
* Minor API changes in the Ast module. Ast API is still considered experimental and
  is not covered by the API stability promise.
* The API of SchemaRetriever has changed significantly, following the changes in
  the upstream Thingpedia API.
* The syntax of Stream Joins have changed from "$stream join $table" to "$stream => $table";
  the old syntax is accepted for compatibility but not generated. Other libraries
  should be updated to follow suit.

  outside of the Almond platform.
